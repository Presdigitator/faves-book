title: Evening Stars
note: Written after a late night walk in December. The shooting star in the third stanza was real.

Darkness settles like silk
Against the sleeping earth,
While overhead the first stars
Pierce through day's fading veil.

Venus leads the dance tonight,
A brilliant diamond suspended
In the violet hour between
Sunset and true dark.

Thenâ€”a streak of light!
A star falls, trailing gold
Across the dome of night,
Gone before I catch my breath.

The evening deepens now
Into velvet black, and stars
Multiply like memories:
Each one a story, each one a world.
