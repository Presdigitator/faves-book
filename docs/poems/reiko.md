Lay me down, lay down to rest.
Hang black curtains, tidy the mess.
Touch a hand light on each arm.
They’re both so tired but love sometimes helps.

Lay me down, lay down my head.
Dust is living in your bed.
Above, a thousand hands come spread.
To stroke my cheek and breast and leg.

I want to be cut adrift on black water,
Lullaby of silence settled on my shoulders.
The skin on my knuckles sands her thumb when she comforts me.
Maybe if I follow fast enough, I’ll never swallow again without you.

I’m glad you had anomalous eye movements.
They made me feel like you weren’t the world looking at me.
Your footsteps make coded messages in the sand.
All I can give you is a waterfall of forgiveness.

No apparitions of ghostly flesh,
The solid things are all that’s left:
Worn drapes, leather seat, ebony desk,
The white barbed-wire behind my chest.

Lay me down, down on the deck.
Winter air behind my neck.
They have gone, they will not check.
I’m not a gambler, but I’ll take this bet.
