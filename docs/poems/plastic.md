# Plastic

Plastic melts.  
Spoon it up with a fork  
And drip it over  
Your friends'  
Fingers.  
Plastic ideas  
Morph from terrifying  
To reasonable,  
Container for your fears:  
A spider in a plastic cup.  
Polymer chains  
Africans  
On ships.  
Plastic moralities.  
Piles and piles and piles,  
Plastic mounds.  
Her palm against her pussy.  
Plastic pressure.  
Pressing, bubbling, beeping,  
Pressure cookers  
Melting plastic in the  
Explosions,  
Scattered,  
Buried,  
Dug up,  
Recycled,  
Built,  
Cities,  
Plastic,  
Plastic,  
My hair:  
Melted,  
Straightened,  
Ironed,  
Straight.  
Iron.  
Pleat.  
Iron.  
Plead.  
Love.  
Lip  
Stick to the pavement,  
Melted  
In the heat,  
Plastic.  
Permanent hair,  
Permanently plastic,  
Promise me you'll never go   
Away.  
Stay straight,   
Stay ring around my finger,  
Melted,  
And then set.
