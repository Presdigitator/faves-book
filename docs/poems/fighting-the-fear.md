title: Fighting The Fear
note: Originally posted on my old Tumblr, on Septermber 11 2014. With the following backstory: “I wrote this as an experiment with patterns of word breaks and assonance, inspired by reading about that kind of thing in the Theory of Literature course I’m doing online at the moment.  I think the poem’s turned out to be about anxiety."

# Fighting The Fear

On your high horse, called the king a pauper.  
Rapid fire doubts, you’re in deep water.  
Flying orca, upside down food fighter,  
You’re a mess-up, but you’re not a liar.  
Would be nicer not running in terror–  
In your courtyard, muscat and a tenor.  
Your confessor, straight from California,  
An amateur, couldn’t stop the nausea.  
Feeling naughtier, desires militant,  
Handjob Castro with arms unlimited.  
Splash\! Lecithin, sulphites, down your elbow,  
Shield your eyeballs, here comes the Tabasco.
