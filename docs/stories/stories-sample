The brass key felt cold against Sarah's palm. It wasn't particularly ornate—just a simple thing with three teeth and a loop at the top worn smooth by decades of handling. But it was the last thing her father had given her.

<div class="chapter-heading">1. The Workshop</div>

Sarah pushed open the door to her father's workshop. Dust motes danced in the shaft of morning light that pierced the gloom. The familiar scent of machine oil and metal filings brought tears to her eyes.

"I shouldn't be here," she whispered to herself, but her feet carried her forward anyway. The workbench stood exactly as he'd left it—tools arranged with mathematical precision, half-finished movements laid out like surgical patients.

"He was a brilliant man, your father," a voice said behind her. Sarah whirled around to find Mrs. Henderson in the doorway, her ancient frame supported by an equally ancient cane.

"I didn't hear you come in," Sarah said.

Mrs. Henderson smiled. "No one ever does, dear. It's a gift." She hobbled into the workshop, her eyes scanning the shelves of clocks. "He was working on something special, you know. Something for you."

Sarah's hand tightened around the key. "What do you mean?"

"Oh, he never told me outright. But I heard the ticking." Mrs. Henderson's eyes took on a distant look. "Not like any clock I'd ever heard before. It sounded almost... alive."

<div class="scene-break"></div>

The workshop held secrets in every shadow. Sarah had spent her childhood here, watching her father's steady hands bring mechanical wonders to life. Now, as she followed Mrs. Henderson's gaze to the highest shelf, she noticed something she'd never seen before: a small clock case, covered in a velvet cloth.

The key in her hand seemed to grow warmer.

"Your father always said," Mrs. Henderson continued, "*time isn't a straight line, sarah. it's a circle, endlessly turning back on itself.*"

Sarah reached for the cloth, her heart pounding. As she pulled it away, the brass and crystal clock beneath it began to tick.

<div class="chapter-heading">2. The Mechanism</div>

The clock face was unlike anything Sarah had ever seen. Instead of numbers, it bore symbols that seemed to shift and change when she wasn't looking directly at them. The hands—there were five of them—moved in patterns that made her head spin.

"Go on," Mrs. Henderson whispered. "Use the key."

Sarah's hand trembled as she slipped the key into the lock. It fit perfectly, of course. Her father's work was always perfect.

She turned it once.

Twice.

Three times.

And the world...

*changed*.
